class DrlConfig:
    """
    A data class to hold DRL config.

    :param str mode: Either 'train' or 'eval'
    :param model_file: The file containing the DRL model. Nullable
    :param model_name: The name of the DRL model
    :param episodes: The number of episodes to run. Negative value means infinite episodes (only for 'eval' mode)
    :param episode_length: The number of steps per episode
    :param state_update_interval: The interval between the state updates in seconds
    :param state_max_inactivity_time: The maximum time in seconds to wait for the state update. If exceeded, the episode is terminated
    :param hyperparams_cfg: Hyperparameters configuration: either a path to a json gile or a dictionary. Nullable
    :param deterministic: Whether the DRL model should be deterministic
    :param callbacks: Optional list of callbacks for SB3 model given as string aliases. One of 'save_model', 'save_step', 'print_step'. Nullable
    :param save_model_path: The path to save the DRL model
    :param save_log_path: The path to save the DRL logs
    :param device: The device to run the DRL model on. Nullable
    :param verbose: The verbosity level. One of 0, 1, 2
